rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync.

rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines,
and remote machines over ssh. The code makes extensive use of hard links
whenever possible, to greatly reduce the disk space required.

It is written entirely in perl with no module dependencies, and has been
tested with versions 5.004 through 5.8.5.

This program should work on any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OS. It
has been tested successfully on the following operating systems:
 - Debian: 3.0 (woody), 3.1 (sarge), unstable (sid)
 - Redhat: 7.x, 8.0, Enterprise Linux 3.0 ES
 - Fedora Core 1, 3
 - CentOS 3, 4
 - WhiteBox Enterprise Linux 3.0
 - Slackware 9.0
 - SuSE: 9.0
 - FreeBSD 4.9-STABLE
 - OpenBSD 3.x
 - Solaris 8 (SPARC and x86)
 - Mac OS X
 - IRIX 6.5


If this is your first experience with rsnapshot, you may want to read the
rsnapshot HOWTO at http://www.rsnapshot.org/

The HOWTO will give you a detailed walk-through on how to get rsnapshot up and
running in explicit detail. For a reference of all available commands, see the
rsnapshot man page.

If you are upgrading from version 1.1.6 or earlier, make sure you read the
file docs/Upgrading_from_1.1.

COMPATIBILITY NOTICES (Please read)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)
  Note that systems which use GNU cp version 5.9 or later will have problems
  with rsnapshot versions up to and including 1.2.3, if cmd_cp is enabled
  (and points at the later gnu cp).  This is no longer a problem since
  rsnapshot 1.2.9, as it strips off trailing slashes when running cp.

(2)
  If you have rsync version 2.5.7 or later, you may want to enable the
  link_dest parameter in the rsnapshot.conf file.
  
  If you are running Linux but do not have the problem above, you should
  enable the cmd_cp parameter in rsnapshot.conf (especially if you do not
  have link_dest enabled).
  
  Be advised that currently link_dest doesn't do well with unavailable hosts.
  Specifically, if a remote host is unavailable using link_dest, there will
  be no latest backup of that machine, and a full re-sync will be required
  when it becomes available. Using the other methods, the last good snapshot
  will be preserved, preventing the need for a re-sync. We hope to streamline
  this in the future.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have installed rsnapshot, you will need to configure it.
The default configuration file is /etc/rsnapshot.conf, although the exact path
may be different depending on how the program was installed. If this
file does not exist, copy /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default over to
/etc/rsnapshot.conf and edit it to suit your tastes. See the man page for
the full list of configuration options.

When /etc/rsnapshot.conf contains your chosen settings, do a quick sanity
check to make sure everything is ready to go:

    rsnapshot configtest

If this works, you can see essentially what will happen when you run it for
real by executing the following command (where interval is hourly, daily, etc):

    rsnapshot -t [interval]

Once you are happy with everything, the final step is to setup a cron job to
automate your backups. Here is a quick example which makes backups every four
hours, and daily backups for a week:
    
    0 */4 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
    50 23 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
    
In the previous example, there will be six "hourly" snapshots
taken each day (at 0,4,8,12,16, and 20 hours). There will also
be daily snapshots taken every night at 11:50PM. The number of
snapshots that are saved depends on the "interval" settings in
/etc/rsnapshot.conf.

For example:
    
    interval    hourly    6
    
This means that every time "rsnapshot hourly" is run, it will make a
new snapshot, rotate the old ones, and retain the most recent six
(hourly.0 - hourly.5).

If you prefer instead to have daily, weekly and monthly backups,
you might set up cron like this:
    00 00 * * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
    00 23 * * 6     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot weekly
    00 22 1 * *     /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot monthly

This specifies a daily rsnapshot at midnight, a weekly snapshot
on Saturdays at 11:00pm and a monthly rsnapshot at 10pm on the
first day of each month.

Note that the backups are done from the highest interval first
(in this case monthly) and go down to the lowest interval.  If
you are not having cron invoke the "hourly" snapshot interval,
then you must also ensure that hourly is not listed as one of 
your intervals in rsnapshot.conf (for example, comment out hourly,
so that "daily" becomes the lowest interval).

Remember that it is only the lowest interval which actually does
the rsync to back up the relevant source directories, the higher
intervals just rotate snapshots around.  Unless you have enabled
sync_first in your rsnapshot.conf, in which case only the "sync"
pseudo-interval does the actual rsync, and all real intervals 
just rotate snapshots.  

For the full documentation, type "man rsnapshot" once it is installed,
or visit http://www.rsnapshot.org/.  The HowTo on the web site has a
detailed overview of how to install and configure rsnapshot, and things
like how to set it up so users can restore their own files.

If you plan on using the "backup_script" parameter in your backup scheme,
take a look at the utils/ directory in the source distribution for several
example scripts.  The utils/rsnapreport.pl script is well worth a look.
