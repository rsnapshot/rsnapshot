1 Introduction
**************

rsnapshot is a filesystem backup utility based on rsync. Using
rsnapshot, it is possible to take snapshots of your filesystems at
different points in time. Using hard links, rsnapshot creates the
illusion of multiple full backups, while only taking up the space of
one full backup plus differences. When coupled with ssh, it is possible
to take snapshots of remote filesystems as well.

   rsnapshot is written in Perl, and depends on rsync. OpenSSH, GNU cp,
GNU du, and the BSD logger program are also recommended, but not
required. All of these should be present on most Linux systems.
rsnapshot is written with the lowest common denominator in mind. It
only requires at minimum Perl 5.004 and rsync. As a result of this, it
works on pretty much any UNIX-like system you care to throw at it. It
has been successfully tested with Perl 5.004 through 5.8.2, on Debian,
Redhat, Fedora, Solaris, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and IRIX.

2 Motivation
************

I originally used Mike Rubel's shell scripts to do rsync snapshots a
while back. These worked very well, but there were a number of things
that I wanted to improve upon. I had to write two shell scripts that
were customized for my server. If I wanted to change the number of
intervals stored, or the parts of the filesystem that were archived,
that meant manually editing these shell scripts. If I wanted to install
them on a different server with a different configuration, this meant
manually editing the scripts for the new server, and hoping the logic
and the sequence of operations was correct. Also, I was doing all the
backups locally, on a single machine, on a single hard drive (just to
protect from dumb user mistakes like deleting files). Never the less, I
continued on with this system for a while, and it did work very well.

   Several months later, the IDE controller on my web server failed
horribly (when I typed `/sbin/shutdown', it said the command was not
found). I was then faced with what was in the back of my mind all
along: I had not been making regular remote backups of my server, and
the local backups were of no use to me since the entire drive was
corrupted. The reason I had only been making sporadic, partial remote
backups is that they weren't automatic and effortless. Of course, this
was no one's fault but my own, but I got frustrated enough to write a
tool that would make automated remote snapshots so easy that I wouldn't
ever have to worry about them again. This goal has long been reached,
but work on rsnapshot still continues as people submit patches, request
features, and ways are found to improve the program.

3 Installation
**************

This section will walk you through the installation of rsnapshot, step
by step. This is not the only way to do it, but it is a way that works
and that is well documented. Feel free to improvise if you know what
you're doing.

   This guide assumes you are installing rsnapshot 1.2.0 for the first
time. If you are upgrading from an earlier version, please read the
`INSTALL' file that comes with the source distribution instead.

3.1 30 second version (for the impatient)
=========================================

     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
     su
     make install
     cp /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /etc/rsnapshot.conf

   The rest of this section is the long version.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Untar the source code package,  Next: Change to the source directory,  Prev: 30 second version [for the impatient],  Up: Installation

3.2 Untar the source code package
=================================

     tar xzvf rsnapshot-1.2.0.tar.gz

   If you don't have GNU `tar', you may have to do this in two steps
instead:

     gunzip rsnapshot-1.2.0.tar.gz
     tar xvf rsnapshot-1.2.0.tar


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Change to the source directory,  Next: Decide where you want to install,  Prev: Untar the source code package,  Up: Installation

3.3 Change to the source directory
==================================

File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Decide where you want to install,  Next: Run the configure script,  Prev: Change to the source directory,  Up: Installation

3.4 Decide where you want to install
====================================

By default, the installation procedure will install all files under
`/usr/local'. For this tutorial, this will be OK except we will install
the config file under `/etc'.

   We are assuming that `rsync', `ssh', `logger', and `du' are all in
your search path. If this is not the case, you can specify the path to
any of these programs using the typical Autoconf
`--with-program=/path/to/program' syntax. For example, if Perl was in
`/opt/bin/perl' and rsync was in `/home/me/bin/rsync', you could run
configure like:

     ./configure --with-perl=/opt/bin/perl --with-rsync=/home/me/bin/rsync


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Run the configure script,  Next: Install the program,  Prev: Decide where you want to install,  Up: Installation

3.5 Run the configure script
============================

This will poke and prod your system to figure out where the various
external programs that rsnapshot depends on live. It also generates the
Makefile that we will use to install the program. The configure script
accepts arguments that can be used to tell it where to install the
program, and also where to find the supporting programs. For this
installation, the only non-default option we want is to put the config
file in the `/etc' directory. To do this, run this command at the shell:

     ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc

   If all goes well, you're ready to install the program. If there was
a problem, it should be descriptive. Most likely a problem would be the
result of something that was required and not found (like rsync or
perl). If this happens, you must figure out where the missing program
is located on your system, or install it if necessary. If you know
where it is but configure couldn't find it, you can specify the path
using the `--with-program=/path/to/program' options described above.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Install the program,  Prev: Run the configure script,  Up: Installation

3.6 Install the program
=======================

If you've followed these instructions so far, you will have configured
rsnapshot to be installed under `/usr/local', with the config file in
`/etc'. Under these circumstances, it will be necessary to become root
to install the program. Now is the time to do so. You will, of course,
need the root password to do this:

     su

   This will prompt you for the root password.

   Now, to install rsnapshot, run the following command:

     make install

   This will install rsnapshot with all the settings you specified in
the ./configure stage. If all goes well, you will have the following
files on your system:

   `/usr/local/bin/rsnapshot' The rsnapshot program

   `/usr/local/man/man1/rsnapshot.1' Man page

   `/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default' The example config file

   If you decide later that you don't want rsnapshot on your system
anymore, simply remove the files listed above, or run `make uninstall'
in the same source directory you installed from. Of course, if you
installed with different options, the location of these files may be
different.

File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Create the config file,  Next: Where to go for more info,  Up: Configuration

4.1 Create the config file
==========================

In the install process, the config file is not created or installed.
However, a working example is provided that you can copy. To copy the
example config file into the location rsnapshot will be looking for the
real config file:

     cp /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /etc/rsnapshot.conf

   As a general rule, you should avoid modifying
`/etc/rsnapshot.conf.default', simply because it is a working example
that you may wish to refer to later. Also, if you perform an upgrade,
the `rsnapshot.conf.default' file will always be upgraded to the latest
version, while your real config file will be safe out of harm's way.
Please note that if you run `make upgrade' during an upgrade, your
rsnapshot.conf may be modified slightly, and the original will then be
saved in `rsnapshot.conf.backup' in the same directory.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Where to go for more info,  Next: Modifying the config file,  Prev: Create the config file,  Up: Configuration

4.2 Where to go for more info
=============================

The `rsnapshot.conf' config file is well commented, and much of it
should be fairly self-explanatory. For a full reference of all the
various options, please consult the rsnapshot man page. Type:

     man rsnapshot

   This will give you the complete documentation. However, it assumes
that you already know what you're doing to a certain extent. If you
just want to get something up and running, this tutorial is a better
place to start. If your system can't find the man page,
`/usr/local/man' probably isn't in your $MANPATH environmental
variable. This is beyond the scope of this document, but if it isn't
working for you, you can always read the newest man page on the
rsnapshot web site at http://www.rsnapshot.org/
(http://www.rsnapshot.org/)

4.3 Modifying the config file
=============================

In this example, we will be using the `/.snapshots/' directory to hold
the filesystem snapshots. This is referred to as the snapshot root.
Feel free to put this anywhere you have lots of free disk space.
However, the examples in this document assume you have not changed this
parameter, so you will have to substitute this in your commands if you
put it somewhere else.

   Also please note that fields are separated by tabs, not spaces. The
reason for this is so it's easier to specify file paths with spaces in
them.

File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: cmd_cp,  Next: cmd_rsync,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.1 cmd_cp
------------

If enabled, the cmd_cp parameter should contain the path to the GNU
`cp' program on your filesystem. If you are using Linux, be sure to
uncomment this by removing the hash mark (#) in front of it. If you are
using BSD, Solaris, IRIX, or most other UNIX variants, you should leave
this commented out.

   What makes GNU `cp' so special is that unlike the traditional UNIX
`cp', it has the ability to make recursive copies of directories as
hard links.

   If you don't have GNU `cp', there is a subroutine in rsnapshot that
somewhat approximates this functionality (although it won't support
more esoteric files such as device nodes, FIFOs, sockets, etc). This
gets followed up by another call to rsync, which transfers the
remaining special files, if any. In this way, rsnapshot can support all
file types on every platform.

   The rule of thumb is that if you're on a Linux system, leave cmd_cp
enabled. If you aren't on a Linux system, leave cmd_cp disabled. There
are reports of GNU `cp' working on BSD and other non-Linux platforms,
but there have also been some cases where problems have been
encountered. If you enable cmd_cp on a non-Linux platform, please let
the mailing list know how it worked out for you.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: cmd_rsync,  Next: cmd_ssh,  Prev: cmd_cp,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.2 cmd_rsync
---------------

The cmd_rsync parameter must not be commented out, and it must point to
a working version of `rsync'. If it doesn't, the program just will not
work at all.

   Please note that if you are using IRIX, there is another program
named `rsync' that is different than the real `rsync' most people know
of. If you're on an IRIX machine, you should double check this.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: cmd_ssh,  Next: cmd_logger,  Prev: cmd_rsync,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.3 cmd_ssh
-------------

If you have `ssh' installed on your system, you will want to uncomment
the cmd_ssh parameter. By enabling `ssh', you can take snapshots of any
number of remote systems. If you don't have `ssh', or plan to only take
snapshots of the local filesystem, you may safely leave this commented
out.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: cmd_logger,  Next: cmd_du,  Prev: cmd_ssh,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.4 cmd_logger
----------------

The cmd_logger parameter specifies the path to the `logger' program.
`logger' is a command line interface to syslog. See the `logger' man
page for more details. `logger' should be a standard part of most
UNIX-like systems. It appears to have remained unchanged since about
1993, which is good for cross-platform stability. If you comment out
this parameter, it will disable syslog support in rsnapshot. It is
recommended that you leave this enabled.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: cmd_du,  Next: link_dest,  Prev: cmd_logger,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.5 cmd_du
------------

The cmd_du parameter specifies the path to the `du' program. `du' is a
command line tool that reports on disk usage. rsnapshot uses `du' to
generate reports about the actual amount of disk space taken up, which
is otherwise difficult to estimate because of all the hard links.

   If you comment this out, rsnapshot will try to use the version of
`du' it finds in your path, if possible. The GNU version of `du' is
recommended, since it has the best selection of features, and supports
the most options. The BSD version also seems to work, although some
versions don't support the `-h' flag. Solaris `du' does not work at
all, because it doesn't support the `-c' parameter.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: link_dest,  Next: interval,  Prev: cmd_du,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.6 link_dest
---------------

If you have `rsync' version 2.5.7 or later, you may want to enable
this. With link_dest enabled, rsnapshot relies on rsync to create
recursive hard links, overriding GNU cp in most, but not all, cases.
With link_dest enabled, every single file on your system can be backed
up in one pass, on any operating system. To get the most out of
rsnapshot on non-Linux platforms, link_dest should be enabled. Be
advised, however, that if a remote host is unavailable during a backup,
rsnapshot will take an extra step and roll back the files from the
previous backup. Using GNU cp, this would not be necessary.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: interval,  Next: backup,  Prev: link_dest,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.7 interval
--------------

rsnapshot has no idea how often you want to take snapshots. Everyone's
backup scheme may be different. In order to specify how much data to
save, you need to tell rsnapshot which intervals to keep, and how many
of each. An interval, in the context of the rsnapshot config file, is a
unit of time measurement. These can actually be named anything (as long
as it's alphanumeric, and not a reserved word), but by convention we
will call ours hourly and daily. In this example, we want to take a
snapshot every four hours, or six times a day (these are the hourly
intervals). We also want to keep a second set, which are taken once a
day, and stored for a week (or seven days). This happens to be the
default, so as you can see the config file reads:

     interval    hourly  6
     interval    daily   7

   It also has some other entries, but you can either ignore them or
comment them out for now.

   Please note that the hourly interval is specified first. This is
very important. The first interval line is assumed to be the smallest
unit of time, with each additional line getting successively larger.
Thus, if you add a yearly interval, it should go at the bottom, and if
you add a minutes interval, it should go before hourly. It's also worth
noting that the snapshots get pulled up from the smallest interval to
the largest. In this example, the daily snapshots get pulled from the
oldest hourly snapshot, not directly from the main filesystem.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: backup,  Next: backup_script,  Prev: interval,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.8 backup
------------

Please note that the destination paths specified here are based on the
assumption that the -relative flag is being passed to `rsync' via the
rsync_long_args parameter. If you are installing for the first time,
this is the default setting. If you upgraded from a previous version,
please read the `INSTALL' file that came with the source distribution
for more information.

   This is the section where you tell rsnapshot what files you actually
want to back up. You put a backup parameter first, followed by the full
path to the directory or network path you're backing up. The third
column is the relative path you want to back up to inside the snapshot
root. Let's look at an example:

     backup      /etc/      localhost/

   In this example, backup tells us it's a backup point. `/etc/' is the
full path to the directory we want to take snapshots of, and
`localhost/' is a directory inside the snapshot_root we're going to put
them in. Using the word localhost as the destination directory is just
a convention. You might also choose to use the server's fully qualified
domain name instead of localhost. If you are taking snapshots of
several machines on one dedicated backup server, it's a good idea to
use their various hostnames as directories to keep track of which files
came from which server.

   In addition to full paths on the local filesystem, you can also
backup remote systems using `rsync' over `ssh'. If you have `ssh'
installed and enabled (via the cmd_ssh parameter), you can specify a
path like:

     backup      root@example.com:/etc/     example.com/

   This behaves fundamentally the same way, but you must take a few
extra things into account.

   * The ssh daemon must be running on example.com

   * You must have access to the account you specify the remote
     machine, in this case the root user on example.com.

   * You must have key-based logins enabled for the root user at
     example.com, without passphrases. If you wanted to perform backups
     as another user, you could specify the other user instead of root
     for the source (i.e. user@domain.com). Please note that allowing
     remote logins with no passphrase is a security risk that may or
     may not be acceptable in your situation. Make sure you guard
     access to the backup server very carefully! For more information
     on how to set this up, please consult the ssh man page, or a
     tutorial on using ssh public and private keys. You will find that
     the key based logins are better in many ways, not just for
     rsnapshot but for convenience and security in general. Troy
     Johnson (http://www.jdmz.net/rsnapshot)'s excellent tutorial on
     using nifty ssh features for secure snapshots which, in case his
     site ever suffers a mishap, is mirrored here
     (http://www.rsnapshot.org/howto/using-rsnapshot-and-ssh.html) on
     this site.

   * This backup occurs over the network, so it may be slower. Since
     this uses `rsync', this is most noticeable during the first
     backup. Depending on how much your data changes, subsequent
     backups should go much, much faster since rsync only sends the
     differences between files.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: backup_script,  Prev: backup,  Up: Modifying the config file

4.3.9 backup_script
-------------------

With this parameter, the second column is the full path to an
executable backup script, and the third column is the local path you
want to store it in (just like with the "backup" parameter). For
example:

     backup_script      /usr/local/bin/backup_pgsql.sh       localhost/postgres/

   In this example, rsnapshot will run the script
`/usr/local/bin/backup_pgsql.sh' in a temp directory, then sync the
results into the `localhost/postgres/' directory under the snapshot
root. You can find the backup_pgsql.sh example script in the `utils/'
directory of the source distribution. Feel free to modify it for your
system.

   Your backup script simply needs to dump out the contents of whatever
it does into it's current working directory. It can create as many
files and/or directories as necessary, but it should not put its files
in any pre-determined path. The reason for this is that rsnapshot
creates a temp directory, changes to that directory, runs the backup
script, and then syncs the contents of the temp directory to the local
path you specified in the third column. A typical backup script would
be one that archives the contents of a database. It might look like
this:

     #!/bin/sh

     /usr/bin/mysqldump -uroot mydatabase > mydatabase.sql
     /bin/chmod 644 mydatabase.sql

   There are several example scripts in the `utils/' directory of the
rsnapshot source distribution to give you more ideas.

   Make sure the destination path you specify is unique. The backup
script will completely overwrite anything in the destination path, so
if you tried to specify the same destination twice, you would be left
with only the files from the last script. Fortunately, rsnapshot will
try to prevent you from doing this when it reads the config file.

   Please remember that these backup scripts will be invoked as the
user running rsnapshot. In our example, this is root. Make sure your
backup scripts are owned by root, and not writable by anyone else. If
you fail to do this, anyone with write access to these backup scripts
will be able to put commands in them that will be run as the root user.
If they are malicious, they could take over your server.


File: rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.info,  Node: Testing your config file,  Prev: Modifying the config file,  Up: Configuration

4.4 Testing your config file
============================

When you have made all your changes, you should verify that the config
file is syntactically valid, and that all the supporting programs are
where you think they are. To do this, run rsnapshot with the configtest
argument:

     rsnapshot configtest

   If all is well, it should say `Syntax OK'. If there's a problem, it
should tell you exactly what it is. Make sure your config file is using
tabs and not spaces, etc.

   The final step to test your configuration is to run rsnapshot in
test mode. This will print out a verbose list of the things it will do,
without actually doing them. To do a test run, run this command:

     rsnapshot -t hourly

   This tells rsnapshot to simulate an "hourly" backup. It should print
out the commands it will perform when it runs for real. Please note
that the test output might be slightly different than the real
execution, but only because the test doesn't actually do things that
may be checked for later in the program. For example, if the program
will create a directory and then later test to see if that directory
exists, the test run might claim that it would create the directory
twice, since it didn't actually get created during the test. This
should be the only type of difference you will see while running a test.

5 Automation
************

Now that you have your config file set up, it's time to set up
rsnapshot to be run from cron. As the root user, edit root's crontab by
typing:

     crontab -e

   You could alternately keep a crontab file that you load in, but the
concepts are the same. You want to enter the following information into
root's crontab:


     0 */4 * * *       /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot hourly
     30 23 * * *       /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot daily

   It is usually a good idea to schedule the larger intervals to run a
bit before the lower ones. For example, in the crontab above, notice
that daily runs 30 minutes before hourly. This helps prevent race
conditions where the daily would try to run before the hourly job had
finished. This same strategy should be extended so that a weekly entry
would run before the daily and so on.

We have a snapshot root under which all backups are stored. By default,
this is the directory `/.snapshots/'. Within this directory, other
directories are created for the various intervals that have been
defined. In the beginning it will be empty, but once rsnapshot has been
running for a week, it should look something like this:


     [root@localhost]# ls -l /.snapshots/
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 00:00 daily.0
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 27 00:00 daily.1
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 26 00:00 daily.2
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 25 00:00 daily.3
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 24 00:00 daily.4
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 23 00:00 daily.5
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 22 00:00 daily.6
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 29 00:00 hourly.0
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 20:00 hourly.1
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 16:00 hourly.2
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 12:00 hourly.3
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 08:00 hourly.4
     drwxr-xr-x    7 root     root         4096 Dec 28 04:00 hourly.5

   Inside each of these directories is a full backup of that point in
time. The destination directory paths you specified under the backup
and backup_script parameters get stuck directly under these
directories. In the example:

     backup          /etc/           localhost/

   The `/etc/' directory will initially get backed up into
`/.snapshots/hourly.0/localhost/etc/'

   Each subsequent time rsnapshot is run with the hourly command, it
will rotate the `hourly.X' directories, and then copy the contents of
the `hourly.0' directory (using hard links) into `hourly.1'.

   When `rsnapshot daily' is run, it will rotate all the `daily.X'
directories, then copy the contents of `hourly.5' into `daily.0'.

   `hourly.0' will always contain the most recent snapshot, and
`daily.6' will always contain a snapshot from a week ago. Unless the
files change between snapshots, the full backups are really just
multiple hard links to the same files. Thus, if your `/etc/passwd' file
doesn't change in a week, `hourly.0/localhost/etc/passwd' and
`daily.6/localhost/etc/passwd' will literally be the same exact file.
This is how rsnapshot can be so efficient on space. If the file changes
at any point, the next backup will unlink the hard link in `hourly.0',
and replace it with a brand new file. This will now take double the
disk space it did before, but it is still considerably less than it
would be to have full unique copies of this file 13 times over.

   Remember that if you are using different intervals than the ones in
this example, the first interval listed is the one that gets updates
directly from the main filesystem. All subsequently listed intervals
pull from the previous intervals. For example, if you had weekly,
monthly, and yearly intervals defined (in that order), the weekly ones
would get updated directly from the filesystem, the monthly ones would
get updated from weekly, and the yearly ones would get updated from
monthly.

7 Restoring backups
*******************

When rsnapshot is first run, it will create the snapshot_root directory
(`/.snapshots/' by default). It assigns this directory the permissions
700, and for good reason. The snapshot root will probably contain files
owned by all sorts of users on your system. If any of these files are
writeable (and of course some of them will be), the users will still
have write access to their files. Thus, if they can see the snapshots
directly, they can modify them, and the integrity of the snapshots can
not be guaranteed.

   For example, if a user had write permission to the backups and
accidentally ran `rm -rf /', they would delete all their files in their
home directory and all the files they owned in the backups!

7.1 root only
=============

The simplest, but least flexible solution, is to simply deny non-root
users access to the snapshot root altogether. The root user will still
have access of course, and as with all other aspects of system
administration, must be trusted not to go messing with things too much.
However, by simply denying access to everyone, the root user will be
the only one who can pull backups. This may or may not be desirable,
depending on your situation. For a small setup or a single-user
machine, this may be all you need.

7.2 All users
=============

If users need to be able to pull their own backups, you will need to do
a little extra work up front (but probably less work in the long run).
The best way to do this seems to be creating a container directory for
the snapshot root with 700 permissions, giving the snapshot root
directory 755 permissions, and mounting the snapshot root for the users
read-only. This can be done over NFS and Samba, to name two
possibilities. Let's explore how to do this using NFS on a single
machine:

   Set the snapshot_root variable in `/etc/rsnapshot.conf' equal to
`/.private/.snapshots/'

     snapshot_root       /.private/.snapshots/

   Create the container directory:

     mkdir /.private/

   Create the real snapshot root:

     mkdir /.private/.snapshots/

   Create the read-only snapshot root mount point:

     mkdir /.snapshots/

   Set the proper permissions on these new directories:

     chmod 0700 /.private/
     chmod 0755 /.private/.snapshots/
     chmod 0755 /.snapshots/

   In `/etc/exports', add `/.private/.snapshots/' as a read only NFS
export:

     /.private/.snapshots/  127.0.0.1(ro,no_root_squash)

   In `/etc/fstab', mount `/.private/.snapshots/' read-only under
`/.snapshots/'

     localhost:/.private/.snapshots/   /.snapshots/   nfs    ro   0 0

   You should now restart your NFS daemon.

   Now mount the read-only snapshot root:

     mount /.snapshots/

   To test this, go into the /.snapshots/ directory as root. It is set
to read-only, so even root shouldn't be able to write to it. As root,
try:

     touch /.snapshots/testfile

   This should fail, citing insufficient permissions. This is what you
want. It means that your users won't be able to mess with the snapshots
either.

   Now, all your users have to do to recover old files is go into the
/.snapshots directory, select the interval they want, and browse
through the filesystem until they find the files they are looking for.
They can't modify anything in here because NFS will prevent them, but
they can copy anything that they had read permission for in the first
place. All the regular filesystem permissions are still at work, but
the read-only NFS mount prevents any writes from happening.

   Please note that some NFS configurations may prevent you from
accessing files that are owned by root and set to only be readable by
root. In this situation, you may wish to pull backups for root from the
"real" snapshot root, and let non-privileged users pull from the
read-only NFS mount.

8 Conclusion
************

If you followed the instructions in this document, you should now have
rsnapshot installed and set up to perform automatic backups of your
system. If it's not working, go back and trace your steps back to see
if you can isolate the problem.

   The amount of disk space taken up will be equal to one full backup,
plus an additional copy of every file that is changed. There is also a
slight disk space overhead with creating multiple hard links, but it's
not very much. On my system, adding a second, completely identical 3
Gigabyte interval alongside the original one only added about 15
Megabytes.

   You can use the du option to rsnapshot to generate disk usage
reports. To see the sum total of all space used, try:

     rsnapshot du

   If you were storing backups under `localhost/home/' and wanted to
see how much this subdirectory takes up throughout all your backups,
try this instead:

     rsnapshot du localhost/home/
