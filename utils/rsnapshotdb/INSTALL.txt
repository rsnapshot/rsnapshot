rsnapshotDB has a few necessary requirements pre-install, as follows

Pre-install Requirements:

1) Perl v. 5.8.7+

2) SSH with ssh-keygen

3) Unix commands: scp, rm, gzip, mysqldump/pg_dump, nice

These need to be inplace on both the remote and/or local server. If using XML conf, then definitely on both servers for scp, rm, gzip, and 'nice'.

The "dumper" programs can be only on the remote server since rsnapshotDB version: 1.2.

5) ssh-keygen public key on remote server

Ideally, you would automate easily by having public/private ssh keys on your servers. See ~/.ssh and 'man ssh-keygen'.

6) local access to database server

This would also negate the need of storing vital (ie - "password") info in the XML config file.

Note: This hasn't been thoroughly tested yet!

7) Copy rsnapshotDB.conf.sample to /etc/rsnapshotDB.conf

BASIC INSTALL:

Place the rsnapshotDB.conf and rsnapshotDB.xsd in a safe location (typicall /etc/) then type $ chmod 600 rsnapshotDB.*

Copy rsnapshotDB.pl into a good location, something like:
/usr/local/bin/rsnapshotDB.pl

Then call it from the rsnapshot.conf file as:

backup_script	/usr/local/bin/rsnapshotDB.pl     database/


SECURITY:

The best option is to use ssh keys and network-authenticated database users. ie (only connect from localhost or 192.168.x.x -> db server without password). This avoids having to store our db passwords in /etc/rsnapshotDB.conf
