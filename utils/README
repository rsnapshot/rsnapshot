The scripts in this folder are mostly quick and dirty examples of things that
you may or may not find useful in conjunction with rsnapshot.

rsnapshot-copy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    rsnapshot-copy copies an rsnapshot snapshot root, preserving the
    intersnapshot hard links for unchanged files.  You can use this if
    you want to copy/move your snapshot root to another place but find
    that rsync -aH on the lot is too slow (uses too much RAM).  It
    copies intervals in chronological order using rsync --link-dest.

rsnaptar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A script that can automatically tar up your latest snapshots and send you
    an e-mail when it's done. You may need to edit some of the variables by
    hand.

backup_dpkg.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup package info on a Debian system, to be invoked
    from rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. If you have a Debian
    system, this will most likely work without changes.

backup_mysql.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a MySQL database, to be invoked from rsnapshot
    using the "backup_script" parameter. You will probably need to modify this
    for your setup.

backup_pgsql.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a PostgreSQL database, to be invoked from
    rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. You will probably need to
    modify this for your setup.

backup_rsnapshot_cvsroot.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup the CVS repository for the rsnapshot project,
    which is hosted on SourceForge. This script is a good example of using
    the wget program to archive web content in your backups. This script is
    designed to be invoked from rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter.

backup_smb_share.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup a Microsoft SMB share, to be invoked from
    rsnapshot using the "backup_script" parameter. This requires the Samba
    program. You will definitely need to modify this for your system.

debug_moving_files.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Debug script for rsync. Moves files around, so you can try backing them
    up to see what rsnapshot does. Only useful if you're having problems
    with vanishing files and want to have a known source of them.

make_cvs_snapshot.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Quick and dirty shell script to find/replace "real" version numbers with
    a CVS-date version.

./rsnapshotdb
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Directory containing rsnapshotDB.pl, a perl script with an XML configuration
    file for remote database backups. Please see ./rsnapshotdb/README.txt.

rsnapshot_if_mounted.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Deprecated. A work-around for using removable drives as the snapshot
    root. Superceded by the "no_create_root" option in rsnapshot proper.

rsnapreport.pl
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This script just takes the output of rsnapshot using the rsync --stats
    option, and generates a pretty report, and tries to include errors at
    the bottom.

sign_packages.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The shell script used to automate package signing for releases.

backup_sqlite.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example script to backup sqlite3 databases located in the `/var` 
    directory.  This is to be invoked from rsnapshot using the "backup_script"
    parameter. You will probably need to modify this for your setup.  Do NOT
    replace `/var` with `/` otherwise find will locate all of your previous
    database backups.
