.IX Title "rsnapshot-diff 1"
.TH rsnapshot-diff 1 "2008-08-31" "" ""
.SH "NAME"
rsnapshot\-diff \- a utility for comparing the disk usage of two snapshots
taken by rsnapshot
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
rsnapshot-diff [\-h|vVi] dir1 dir2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
rsnapshot-diff is a companion utility for rsnapshot, which traverses two
parallel directory structures and calculates the difference between them.
By default it is silent apart from displaying summary information at the
end, but it can be made more verbose.
.PP
In the summary, \*(L"added\*(R" files may very well include files which at first
glance also appear at the same place in the older directory structure.
However, because the files differ in some respect, they are different files.
They have a different inode number.  Consequently if you use \-v most of its
output may appear to be pairs of files with the same name being removed
and added.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\-h (help)" 4
.IX Item "-h (help)"
Displays help information
.IP "\-v (verbose)" 4
.IX Item "-v (verbose)"
Be verbose.  This will spit out a list of all changes as they are encountered,
as well as the summary at the end.
.IP "\-V (more verbose)" 4
.IX Item "-V (more verbose)"
Be more verbose \- as well as listed changes, unchanged files will be listed
too.
.IP "\-i (ignore)" 4
.IX Item "-i (ignore)"
If verbosity is turned on, \-i suppresses information about symlinks,
directories, and special files.
.IP "dir1 and dir2" 4
.IX Item "dir1 and dir2"
These are the only compulsory parameters, and should be the names of two
directories to compare.  Their order doesn't matter, rsnapshot-diff will
always compare the younger to the older, so files that appear only in the
older will be reported as having been removed, and files that appear only
in the younger will be reported as having been added.
