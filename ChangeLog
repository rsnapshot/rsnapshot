VERSION 1.4.3 (Nov 17 2019)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixes and minor updates to Pod / man page.
- Adds more tests.
- Restore rsync error code 23 as an important warning.
- Fixes shortargs appending.
- Non-LVM backup source breaks after LVM backup source.

VERSION 1.4.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Properly capture rsyncs exitcode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tidy the code with perltidy
- Fix --rsh command line option
  The --rsh option of rsync got errornously quoted (Debian Bug #743310)
- Define traps to unmount LVM parts after fail
  If you use LVM snapshots and rsnapshot fails, rsnapshot will unmount and
  remove the snapshot, too.
- cd to home before executing a command
- if($use_lazy_deletes): remove lockfile in any case
- Bail on failing cmd_(pre|post)exec
  If one of those commands fails, rsnapshot will exit with exit code != 0
- Capture output from rsync and print/log if level is >=4
- Print rsnpashot's PID when logging to syslog, instead of the logger's PID.
- make script uses pod2man instead of /usr/bin/pod2man
- rsnapshot-diff: Fixed removed files reported as addition (+ mark)
- Introduction of backup_exec resource for running unix commands interspersed
  with backup and backup_script jobs.
- check for SIGPIPE, mainly in case cron fails when trying to mail
  (this is probably why rsnapshot dies mysteriously if it outputs when
  called by cron on a system which does not have mail working).
- add test case for -t showing --link-dest when there is only one snapshot
- if gnu_cp_al fails, test out a simple cp -al command before suggesting
  that the cp does not support -al.
- When snapshot_root does not exist, check existence of parent directories.
- include_conf `command` now strips backticks before execution (bug fix
  based on suggestion from David Osborn).
- Ignore extraneous output from lvremove command.  (patch by Tim Connors)
- Update current maintainer status in Authors section of man page.
  (David Cantrell stepped down between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1.)
- Remove some old (1.1.x -> 1.2.0) upgrade notices from man page.
- Allow linux_lvm_cmd_* in config file to have options also.
- Allow `backticks with options` in include_conf.
- Fix inaccurate omission of --link-dest in test-mode output
- rsnapshot-diff: Add -s option to show size of each file.

VERSION 1.3.1  (Aug 31 2008)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix help message mixup in lines between -c and -t.
- Add more specific error messages for not currently implemented potential
  per backup point options, like cmd_preexec.
- Allow named pipe as logfile - suggested by Patrice Levesque.
- Include rsnapshot-copy script written by Matt McCutchen.
- Allow `backticks` in include_conf.
- Apply fix-sync_first-rollback.diff patch from Matt McCutchen (02 Apr 2008).
- Fix bug with link_dest not being used on second and later backups
  when you have link_dest 1 and sync_first 1. (Ignore $sync_dir_was_present)
- Patch from Adam Greenbaum to allow passing of ssh arguments correctly.
- David Grant added rsync_numtries to rsnapshot.conf.
- Applied Ben Low's Linux LVM patch.
- Added stop_on_stale_lockfile, thanks to Henning Moll.
- Michael Ashley's fix for filter/space problems on the rsync command line.
- Remove trailing whitespace from command names in rsnapshot.conf.
- Warn about extra spaces between tab and argument.
- Added multi-line config options, thanks to Dieter Bloms.
- The 'interval' config option is now called 'retain'.
- chdir to avoid an obscure bug in some versions of GNU rm.
- Changed use_lazy_deletes option to use _delete.$$ directories.
- Added note about -H and hard links to docs for rsync_short_args.
- Include rsnapshot-diff.1 in rpm.
- Fix bug with rsnapshot sync the first time (when .sync does not exist)
  trying to copy hourly.0 to .sync, even if hourly.0 doesn't exist.

  strips trailing slashes for gnu cp with rsnapshot 1.2.9 and later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 1.0.1 (Oct 18 03:22 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure the snapshot directory either needs to be created or already is a
  directory. Previously we were checking only if the snapshot root existed,
  which would cause problems if it were a file.
- Cleaned up and streamlined the config file parsing portion of the code.
- Changed numeric comparisons so that a typo would prevent compilation,
  instead of acting weird. i.e. (0 == $foo) instead of ($foo == 0)

VERSION 1.0.0 (Sep 14 02:58 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed backward compatibility cruft for mkdir, touch, rm, and mv.
- rsnapshot has now been tested successfully on Debian and Redhat Linux, as well
  as IRIX and Solaris.
- Man pages are no longer gzipped, for compatibility with Solaris and others.

VERSION 0.9.5 (Sep 9 20:11 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed most dependencies on external shell programs.
- Added compatibility for non-Linux platforms.
- Did significant testing/debugging to ensure compatibility with perl 5.004,
  5.6, and 5.8
- Tested and working successfully on IRIX, more tests to follow.

VERSION 0.9.4 (Sep 1 23:55 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Heavily commented variables, and added much stricter syntax checking of the
  config file.
- Additional error checking on mkdir
- updated the man page.

VERSION 0.9.3 (Sep 1 01:46 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anonymous rsync connections now supported.
- Reverted back from recycling the oldest snapshots to the tried and true
  method of deleting the old ones.
- Now rsnapshot will not only create the snapshot root directory as it did
  before, but it will also chmod 0700 the directory when it creates it.

VERSION 0.9.2 (Aug 31 04:08 2003)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Optimized rotating snapshot intervals by recycling the last directory to the
  first, instead of deleting the last and copying .0 to .1
- Added support for spaces in path names.
- The config file now requires tabs to seperate all entries, where spaces were
  before acceptable. This was the easiest way to support spaces in path names.
- Directory entries now require a trailing slash. This is so that files can be
  treated correctly without having to be examined directly (which is
  impractical over rsync/ssh).
