------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------
  QUICK START
---------------
If you are installing for the first time (and just want the defaults):

    Run these commands for a quick installation from source code:
    (skip these commands if you have installed rpm or debian package)

        ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
        su
        make install
        cp /etc/rsnapshot.conf.default /etc/rsnapshot.conf

    Open up /etc/rsnapshot.conf with a text editor, and modify it for your
    system.

    Make sure the config file syntax is valid (remember, tabs, not spaces):

        /usr/local/bin/rsnapshot configtest

    The rsnapshot HOWTO is recommended reading for first time setups. It will
    walk you through this process in great detail.

    The rsnapshot HOWTO can be found online at http://www.rsnapshot.org/

  UPGRADING
-------------
If you are upgrading from a previous installation of rsnapshot 1.1.x,
please read the file:
	docs/Upgrading_from_1.1

There are no special instructions for upgrading from rsnapshot 1.2.x to
1.3.x, since both use config_version 1.2.  

If you are not sure whether you need to do anything to upgrade your
old rsnapshot.conf, you can run
	make upgrade
or
	rsnapshot upgrade-config-file
or
	rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot.conf upgrade-config-file


    
----------------------
  ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
----------------------
If you require more precise control over the locations of files:

    You can pass the following options to ./configure for more control
    over where various parts of rsnapshot are installed. The example
    values shown also happen to be the defaults.

        --prefix=/usr/local
            This will install everything under /usr/local

        --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
            This will install the example config file
            (rsnapshot.conf.default) under /usr/local/etc. This will also be
            the default directory where rsnapshot looks for its config file.
            It is recommended that you copy rsnapshot.conf.default and use it
            as a basis for the actual config file (rsnapshot.conf).

        --bindir=/usr/local/bin
            This will install the rsnapshot program under /usr/local/bin

        --mandir=/usr/local/man
            This will install the man page under /usr/local/man

        --with-perl=/usr/bin/perl
            Specify your preferred path to perl. If you don't specify
            this, the build process will detect the first version of perl
            it finds in your path.

        --with-rsync=/usr/bin/rsync
            Specify your preferred path to rsync. If you don't specify
            this, the build process will detect the first version of rsync
            it finds in your path. You can always change this later by
            editing the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

        --with-cp=/bin/cp
            Specify the path to GNU cp. The traditional UNIX cp command
            is not sufficient. If you don't specify this, the build process
            will detect the first version of cp it finds in your path.
            If you don't have the GNU version of cp, leave this commented
            out in the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

        --with-rm=/bin/rm
            Specify the path to the rm command. If you don't specify this,
            the build process will detect the first version of rm it finds
            in your path.

        --with-ssh=/usr/bin/ssh
            Specify your preferred path to ssh. If you don't specify this,
            the build process will detect the first version of ssh it
            finds in your path. SSH is an optional feature, so it is OK if
            it isn't on your system. Either way, if you want to use ssh,
            you need to specifically enable this feature by uncommenting
            the "cmd_ssh" parameter in the config file (rsnapshot.conf).

        --with-logger=/usr/bin/logger
            Specify your preferred path to logger. If you don't specify
            this, the build process will detect the first version of
            logger it finds in your path. If you want syslog support,
            make sure this is enabled in the config file. Syslog support
            is optional, so if you don't have it or comment it out it's OK.

        --with-du=/usr/bin/du
            Specify your preferred path to du. If you don't specify
            this, the build process will detect the first version of
            du it finds in your path. The "du" command only gets used
            when rsnapshot is called with the "du" argument to calculate
            the amount of disk space used. This is optional, so if you
            don't have it or comment it out it's OK.
